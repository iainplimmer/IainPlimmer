        <p>One of the greatest features of Core (and there are many) is that it allows you to build your very own
            request pipeline that underpins the unified 'API' and 'MVC' patterns.</p>

        <h5>Posted on 19 December 2016 by Iain Plimmer</h5>
        <p>Sometimes it's useful to create a promise in javascript without wanting to immediately resolve it. One use case is OK/Cancel confrmation dialogs. Here I explore this a little by example.</p>

        <p>This week i've been in the discussion on this very topic on Reddit, a developer raised the question for advice and was seemingly hitting the same hurdles that I was jumping over a couple of years ago.</p>

        <h1><a href="angular-directives.html">Angular 1.x Directives</a></h1>

        <h5>Posted on 1 September 2016 by Iain Plimmer</h5>
        <p>While looking at ReactJS this week I came back over the Javascript bind() method and not having used it since AngularJS had to do a quick google. It's not entirely apparent what's going on at first so I thought i'd make a short blog post on it.</p>

        <h1><a href="javascript-promises.html">Javascript Promises</a></h1>
        <h5>Posted on 30 July 2016 by Iain Plimmer</h5>
        <p>Now that Javascript promises are here natively, without external libraries in 74.46% of browsers it's a good time to dig in and get started using them in your Javascript applications.</p>

        <h5>Posted on 2 June 2015 by Iain Plimmer</h5>
        <p>I've been doing rather alot of AngularJS in recent weeks and filters are really, really cool. Never want to hear the word Voldemort? Use a filter!</p>
