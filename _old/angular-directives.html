        <h1>Angular 1.x Directives</h1>
        <h5>Posted on 2 October 2016 by Iain Plimmer</h5>
        
        <p>Since the release of Angular 1.5, components have been a great way to encapsulate functionality and sprinke in reusable code around web applications. Directives have an important place still, but rather than building reusable pieces of our application as directives, it's more in-tune to use these for behaviour driven events on existing elements.</p>
        
        <h3>When should I use them?</h3>
        
        <p>We should be using directives to attach to existing elements in our DOM tree to attach behaviours. We can still create components, but the new component systax that has been included in 1.5 is far superior. Want a custom click? You should still use a directive. Want a new input box with custom style, and behaviour that you will use again? A component will likely be your best bet.</p>
        
        <h3>A simple working example...</h3>

        <p>A good starting case for a directive would be taking a click, or a mouseover event. Take the following code, we can decorate the DOM element with an attribute called 'highlightme'. When we hover over this element, we want to change the style.</p>

        <pre>&lt;p highlightme&gt;Let's highlight some text&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

        <p>So to hook this up, let's build a directive and call it 'highlightme'. I've set the 'restrict' property to 'A' which means that it will picked up as an attribute, and we've created a link function; this allows us to dig into the attributes, scope and element of the DOM element decorated with the 'highlightme' attribute. Really handy and very cool.</p>

        <pre>.directive('highlightme', function() {
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        link: function (scope, element, attrs) {
            element.on('mouseover', function () {
                element.css({
                    border: '1px solid black',
                });
            })
            element.on('mouseleave', function () {
                element.css({
                    border: '0px',
                });
            })
        }
    };
})</pre>

        <h3>Finally...</h3>
        <p>With access to the DOM element that the directive is attached to, it's possible to do make any behaviour. It's important to remember that ng-click, ng-model, ng-repeat are all just directives, in fact AngularJS is built with AngularJS.</p>
        <p>That in mind, think about it - how would you create ng-click from scratch? Set yourself that task :) it's pretty fun.</p>
        <p>Here's my solution, didn't take long but made me think! There's probably a far better way though :)</p>

        <pre>.directive('clicky', function() {
    return {
        restrict: 'A',      
        scope: true,              
        link: function (scope, element, attrs) {
            element.on('click', function () {
                eval('scope.$parent.' + attrs.clicky);                             
            });
        }
    };
})</pre>

        <p>And the usage is the same as an 'ng-click'' directive.</p>
        <pre>&lt;button clicky="$ctrl.myfunction('something, here?')"&gt;Clicky!&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
