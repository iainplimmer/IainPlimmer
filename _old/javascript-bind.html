        <h1>Function.prototype.bind()</h1>
        <h5>Posted on 1 September 2016 by Iain Plimmer</h5>

        <p>While looking at ReactJS this week I came back over the Javascript bind() method and not having used it since AngularJS had to do a quick google. It's not entirely apparent what's going on at first so I thought i'd make a short blog post on it.</p>
        <p>Looking at the docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind" target="_blank"></a> just gives me more questions than answers, but the synopsis is:</p>
        <p><i>The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.</i></p>
        <p>I can simplify this: it's just a way of putting a function on an object, and maintaining the 'this' as the object within that function's scope.</p>
        <p>Let's look at a simple example of a person object. I want to add a year to this object. Let's call it 'addBirthday'.</p>
        <pre>
var person = {
    name : 'Iain',
    age : 39
};

var addBirthday = function() {
    this['age']++;
}
        </pre>
        <p>We can use Function.prototype.bind() to add this function to the object. Then when we call that function, the 'this' keyword refers to the actual object, not the scope of the function :) Pretty sweet.</p>
        <pre>
this.person.AddBirthday = this.addBirthday.bind(person);
//  Age will now be set to 40 
        </pre>
        <p>Now, what about if we want to take a propery from the object? that's simple too, because we are already in the scope of the object, meaning that we can apply this function to any object.</p>
        <pre>
var FetchProperty = function(prop) {
    console.log('Your value is ' + this[prop] + 'sir');
};
this.person.FetchProperty = this.FetchProperty.bind(person);
this.person.FetchProperty('name'); 
// Outputs : 'Iain'
        </pre>
        <h3>Finally....</h3>
        <p>Javascript is highly expressive. Function binding isn't something that you need right away, but it's super useful, and an alternative to the madness of using 'self' or '_this' all over the shop. That's not to say they are wrong, just a different approach.</p>
