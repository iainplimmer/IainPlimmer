        <h1>Javascript Promises - Part 2</h1>
        <h5>Posted on 19 December 2016 by Iain Plimmer</h5>
        
        <p>Sometimes it's useful to create a promise in javascript without wanting to immediately resolve it. One use case is OK/Cancel confrmation dialogs.</p>
        
        <p>If you are unfamiliar with promises you can read my article from <a href="http://www.iainplimmer.co.uk/javascript-promises.html">July 2016</a> where I ask this question and explore a simple use case.</p>
        
        <h3>Why follow up the original article?</h3>

        <p>I had a use case for implementing an OK/Cancel modal last week, and was tired of seeing the same code repeated, IE, the OK and Cancel functions that are repeated everywhere with callbacks. Eugh, it looks horrible and forces the programmer to hunt down the events. So... what about using a promise with THEN and CATCH for this implementation? It makes sense, but there are a few things to understand and work around to get this working. </p>

        <p>Awaiting a user action IS async and can be treated this way and handled by a promise, consider this code to show a modal, then await an action by the user in the form of a promise.</p>

<pre>
// This function creates our Modal and shows it on the screen for us.    
ConfirmDialog.Show() 
    .then(function (success) {
        ... do something if the user presses OK
    })
    .catch(function (reason) {
        ... do something if the user presses Cancel
    });    
</pre>

        <p>Nice? It really is, it makes sense to the brain as you can see the flow of the process. There is no looking for the function later, we hand off responsiblity to the 'ConfirmDialog' to tell US when the user presses OK (resolve or reject), so no additional events attached to the DOM from our side.</p>

        <h3>The Implementation</h3>
        <p>To get this working, i've created a module - called 'ConfirmDialog'. In here we can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Show the dialog</li>
            <li>Handle 'Ok' being clicked with a 'then'</li>
            <li>Handle 'Cancel' being clicked with a 'catch'</li>
        </ul>

<p>The HTML for our user's screen will look like this, usually i'd create a full module that encapsulates the look and feel of the modal, but in this example we're just going to see it in line with the rest of the code to show how it works.</p>

<pre>
&lt;a href="#" onclick="StartWork()">Click me&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id="modal" style="display:none"&gt;
    &lt;p>Do you want to do the action?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;a href="#" onclick="ConfirmDialog.OK()"&gt;OK&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a href="#" onclick="ConfirmDialog.Cancel()"&gt;Cancel&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div>    
</pre>

<p>There still needs to be some javascript that will handle us starting up the modal - so let's create the function to handle that locally. It's important to note that your business logic will go in the 'then' and 'catch' as we don't want the control to be handled by our dialog.</p>

<pre>
function StartWork () {
    ConfirmDialog.Show()
        .then(function (success) {
            ... do something if the user presses OK
        })
        .catch(function (reason) {
            ... do something if the user presses Cancel
        });
}    
</pre>

<p>Finally, the big reveal - what does our ConfirmDialog module look like?</p>

<pre>
var ConfirmDialog = (function () {

    var _deferredOk;
    var _deferredCancel;
    var p;

    function _ok () {        
        _deferredOk(true);  
    }
    
    function _cancel () {
        _deferredCancel(false);    
    }

    function _create () {    

        //  We mix in with the front end for this example, usually this would to TOTALLY independent, but i've kept it clean for the example.
        var modal = document.getElementById("modal");    
        modal.style.display = '';
        ////////////////////////////////////////

        p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
            _deferredOk = resolve;
            _deferredCancel = reject;
        });

        return p;
    } 

    return {
        Show : _create,  
        OK : _ok,   
        Cancel : _cancel        
    } 
})();     
</pre>

<p>Simple really, when the module is called, we create the promise. The resolve and reject actions are handed off to local functions and we immediately return the promise to the caller.</p>
<p>The caller then awaits the resolve (or reject) action from the user using the 'then' and 'catch' functions, holding up execution of the main program until the user has made their choice. </p>

        <h3>Finally...</h3>
        <p>Promises are powerful, they can replace any action that could take an indeterminate amount of time. These examples include awaiting a user's action, a fetch request to be fulfilled in the browser, or files being read or written. All these actions need not block the rest of the program executing, and promises offer a 'when you are ready do this later' option. It's pretty neat.</p>
