        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h3>Hello! I'm a developer from Tamworth, England. This is my personal site.</h3>

        <p>I've been programming a while, but nowadays I tend to focus my time when developing with C#, Javascript, AngularJS, Azure, ASP.NET WebAPI and (of course) HTML but in the past I have be known to turn my hand to Coldfusion, ASP.NET, MVC, JQuery (It's still useful sometimes!), KnockoutJS and SOAP webservices. I've written a few applications in my time and like to think security first. I understand and use design patterns and foremost am rekindling my love of programming with front end web applications after years of management. At the database level I am most accomplished with SQL Server and understand normalisation, optimisation of storage and retrieval & the need for datawarehousing.</p>

        <p>In my spare time I love running, family time, reading and contributing to open source. I've developed and worked on a few open source projects too and right now i'm trying to level up my Javascript skills with Angular2 and ReactJS.</p>

        <p>A couple of the libraries i've worked on tend to get downloaded around 500 times a month, so it's great that they are used :)</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-gridify">ngGridify</a> - AngularJS</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gangle">Gangle!</a> - NodeJS</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I've also written a few Javascript games with my kids, which has been fun :) I'm currently playing with canvas to level this up with a 'DrawMyThing' game in ReactJS.</p>
