        <h1>ASP.NET Core Middleware</h1>
        <h5>Posted on 23 December 2016 by Iain Plimmer</h5>
        
        <p>ASP.NET Core is a massive reimagining of the ageing ASP.NET. As as time goes on, more and more
            of the original framework creeps back ready to be used. Currently (version 1.1.0) is pretty 
            healty and is usable on the MAC with VS Code from development to deployment.   
        </p>
        <p>One of the greatest features of Core (and there are many) is that it lives on the MVC paradigm, 
            which seperates not only models, views and controllers, but allows you to build your very own
            request pipeline that underpins the unified 'API' and 'MVC' patterns.
        </p>
        <p>Creating Middleware is just a process of pushing a RequestDelegate into the pipeline, in whatever
            order you wish. You may want to create many 'middlewares' that you want running in a particular order.
            The idea is that one Middleware passes onto the next, then onto the next, neither handing off until the
            last has completed. </p>
        <p>At any point you can just kill a request dead and provide some information to the caller
            using a HTTP status code, and a message like this very basic example. Very handy.</p>
<pre>
context.Response.StatusCode = 400;
await context.Response.WriteAsync("You must supply an authentication key.");
return;            
</pre>
        <p>Nice. Also, it's possible to build this pipeline up. In the 'startup.cs' file, here's an idea of what you can do with some abstract ideas.</p>
<pre>
app.UseMVC();
app.UseMiddleware<CheckIpValid>();
app.UseMiddleware<AuthenticateRequestToken>();
app.UseMiddleware<LogRequestToDatabase>();
</pre>
        <h3>A Custom Middleware Implementation</h3>
        <p>So, i'm going to write a middleware for example now, this middleware is going to sit in our request pipeline and check for the following rules, 
            if any of these rules fail, we show an error, otherwise we just allow the middleware to chain to the next middleware in the queue.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does the request come into the url path '/API/*'?</li>
            <li>Does the request have a header called 'auth-key'?</li>
        </ul>     
        <p>And that's it, this is an aritary 'key' for example, but in the real world, we might want 
            to check that they key is a certain length, if it exists in the database, if it is a one
            time only key, etc. For now, we just check there is indeed, the presence of an 'auth-key'.</p>       

<pre>
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class AuthenticateRequest
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public AuthenticateRequest(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)  
    {
        //  Let's setup some variables to test the path and see if the authentication
        //  key has been provided to the request.
        var path = context.Request.Path.ToString();
        var headerKeys = context.Request.Headers.Keys;
        var hasAuthKey = headerKeys.Contains("auth-key");

        //  Only check this key is present when using the API, normal 'MVC' routes are excluded
        if (path != null && path.Length > 4 
            && !hasAuthKey 
            && path.Substring(0,5).ToLower() == "/api/")
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = 400;
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("You must supply an authentication key.");
            return;
        }

        await _next.Invoke(context);
    }
}
</pre>
        <p>And to add it to our request pipeline with other Middleware? It's really just as simple as this line to our 'StartUp.cs'' file:</p>
<pre>
app.UseMiddleware<AuthenticateRequest>();
</pre>        

        <h3>Finally...</h3>
        <p>Middleware is neat. There's no question that it cleans up the pipeline and leaves an MVC or API application to 
            just do what it does in the controller without deriving from a base class or calling functions from within controllers.            
        </p>
        <p>The best thing about ASP.NET Core though is that it works on Mac, and you can deploy to Azure. Run anywhere is actually becoming truth. </p>
